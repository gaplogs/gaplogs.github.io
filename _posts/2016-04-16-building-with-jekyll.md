##Building with Jekyll

I've been told [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the static-site generator, is a breeze to use. I've seen some bloggers root for it online with the same fervour you'd expect from some physicists over string theory. And similarly, to get in on the ease-of-use, I think you first need to have been annoyed with the complexity of other blogging platforms. And I'm not annoyed by other blogging platforms because I didn't have to build _with_ them, only use them.

So when I first built with Jekyll, it felt like such a pain. It took me over four hours to get a proper blog going, and I was barely thrilled that I'd come out alive (I'm usually thrilled when I figure out any kind of programming). But I was insistent on continuing because... I cofounded a news startup last year (we secured funding for it in December) that's been forcing me, as all startups should, to make no mistakes, keep my head above the water at all times, and always be aware of what kind of audience I'm feeding. While my cofounders have the editorial bits covered, I'm more about what technology is powering platforms today, how it's used to shape content, and what it can tell us about the people we're serving.

And when I first found static site generators, it seemed like they featured an oh-so-little amount of development that it seemed like the perfect thing with which to learn the grammar of building CMSes.

So yeah â€“ I continued, and next decided to get myself on GitHub Pages. And that's when I realised how Jekyll could be a breeze to use. It took me about 20 minutes to put this blog together (though I know it's got a lot of work left). Then finding prose.io made me more thrilled: I quite like its writing environment, doesn't make me feel too intimidated, and the markdown editor is pretty awesome. As someone who appreciates an economy of resources in the smallest things, and minimalist design, a blog like this feels pretty good for the soul.

Oh, before I forget: if you went looking, the whole process of creating a Pages + Jekyll site for a non-developer isn't easy to find. So here's a [very handy guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages) by Jonathan McGlone and this useful addition from [Mark Dotto](http://markdotto.com/2014/02/28/including-css-in-jekyll/).
