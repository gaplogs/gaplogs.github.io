I’ve always wanted a blog with a CMS that wouldn’t get in the way of my writing. WordPress used to do that but then I got used to it. Yet, I still wanted something that’d just be this collection of files on the web, something you could find at a given location at all times, and not something encouched in giant hunks of code, something whose existence was as assured as the code’s. This is why static site generators briefly got me excited before I noticed many of them were aimed at developers. Then, I discovered prose.io yesterday – and decided to give it a spin with GitHub Pages.

This is it.

What do you think?
